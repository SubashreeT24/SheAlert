## 📖 1. Overview

**SheAlert** is a real-time women's safety monitoring system that combines a wearable/embedded hardware device with a mobile app to send emergency alerts through two modes:

- 🎙️ **Automatic Mode** — Continuously listens for a secret trigger word ("**blueberry**"). Once detected, it captures a photo, records audio evidence, and instantly notifies emergency contacts over WhatsApp with **location, timestamp, and evidence (image URL and audio `.wav` file)**.
- 🆘 **Manual Mode** — A press-and-hold SOS button in the companion Flutter app for situations where speed matters more than evidence, sending just live location and timestamp.

The system is designed around a simple principle: **automatic mode maximizes evidence, manual mode maximizes speed.**

---

## ✨ 2. Features

- 🔊 Continuous audio monitoring with wake-word detection (trigger word: `blueberry`)
- 📸 Automatic photo capture on trigger via onboard ESP32-S3 camera
- 🎤 Audio evidence recording (`.wav`) alongside every automatic alert
- 📍 Real-time GPS location tracking in the mobile app
- 📲 Instant WhatsApp alerts with image, audio, location & timestamp
- ⚡ One-touch **Manual SOS** (2-second press) for fast, evidence-free alerts
- 💓 Heartbeat-based device connectivity status (device online/offline)
- 👥 Priority-ordered emergency contacts (up to 5, reorderable, swipe-to-delete with confirmation)
- 📊 Alert history with Manual / Automatic / All filters + weekly stats
- ☁️ Realtime sync between hardware, backend, and mobile app via Firebase

## 🛠️ 3. Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Hardware** | XIAO ESP32-S3 Sense (Camera + PDM Mic) | Captures audio continuously & photo on trigger |
| **Firmware** | Arduino (C++), `esp_camera`, `ESP_I2S` | Records audio, controls camera, sends heartbeat |
| **Backend** | Node.js (Firebase Cloud Functions) — `index.js` | Processes audio, manages alerts, uploads media |
| **Speech-to-Text** | ElevenLabs API | Converts recorded audio to text for trigger detection |
| **Database** | Firebase Firestore | Stores alerts (classified automatic/manual) & contacts |
| **File Storage** | Firebase Storage | Stores captured images & `.wav` audio files |
| **Notifications** | CircuitDigest Cloud API | Sends WhatsApp alerts to emergency contacts |
| **Mobile App** | Flutter (Dart) | Home, History, and Contacts management UI |
| **Realtime Sync** | Firebase Firestore listeners | Live device status & alert history updates |

## 🧩 4. System Architecture

### 4.1 Component Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["📡 ESP32-S3<br/>Mic + Camera"] --> B["☁️ Cloud Backend<br/>Cloud Functions"]
    B --> C["Firestore<br/>Database"]
    B --> D["ElevenLabs<br/>Speech-to-Text"]
    B --> E["Firebase Storage<br/>Media"]
    B --> F["CircuitDigest<br/>WhatsApp Alerts"]
    C --> G["📱 Mobile App +<br/>Emergency Contact"]
    D --> G
    E --> G
    F --> G
```

> The device streams audio/photo to the Cloud Backend, which fans out to four services — Firestore for alert & contact records, ElevenLabs for trigger-word transcription, Storage for media, and CircuitDigest for the WhatsApp send — and everything converges at the mobile app / emergency contact.

### 4.2 Alert Flow — Automatic vs Manual

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["🎙️ Record 5s<br/>audio clip"] --> B["Transcribe<br/>(ElevenLabs)"]
    B --> C{"Trigger word<br/>found?"}
    C -- No --> W["⏳ Wait 3s"] --> A
    C -- Yes --> D["Create alert<br/>(automatic) + capture photo"]
    D --> E["Store audio + photo<br/>in Storage"]
    E --> F["Send WhatsApp alert<br/>(CircuitDigest)"]
    F --> G["✅ Contact gets:<br/>image + audio + location + time"]

    H["📱 Hold SOS<br/>(2s)"] --> I["Create alert<br/>(manual) + get GPS"]
    I --> J["Send WhatsApp alert<br/>(CircuitDigest)"]
    J --> K["✅ Contact gets:<br/>location + time"]
```

> **Why two modes?** Automatic mode takes longer since it waits on audio recording, transcription, and photo upload — but produces stronger evidence. Manual mode skips all of that for near-instant delivery when every second counts. Each listening cycle records for **5 seconds**, transcribes and checks for the trigger word, and if not found, **waits 3 seconds** before starting the next cycle.

## 🔩 5. Core Modules

### 5.1 Hardware — XIAO ESP32-S3 Sense

| Component | Detail |
|---|---|
| Microcontroller | ESP32-S3 (XIAO Sense variant) |
| Microphone | PDM mic via `ESP_I2S` — Clock: GPIO 42, Data: GPIO 41 |
| Camera | OV-series camera module (JPEG, VGA resolution, quality 12) |
| Sample Rate | 16 kHz, mono, 16-bit |
| Recording Window | 5 seconds per listening cycle, with a 3-second pause before the next cycle if no trigger word is found |
| Connectivity | Wi-Fi (HTTPS to Firebase Cloud Functions) |
| Heartbeat Interval | Every 30 seconds |

### 5.2 Backend — `index.js` (Firebase Cloud Functions, `asia-southeast1`)

| Endpoint | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `processAudio` | Receives `.wav` audio, sends to ElevenLabs STT, checks for trigger word, creates alert in Firestore, stores audio in Storage, and triggers the WhatsApp alert via CircuitDigest |
| `uploadPhoto` | Receives JPEG photo, stores in Firebase Storage, links to alert, triggers WhatsApp send with the photo |
| `heartbeat` | Updates device "last seen" timestamp in Firestore for online/offline status |

### 5.3 Mobile App — Flutter

| Page | Functionality |
|---|---|
| **Home** | Connection status (device + internet), live GPS location, contact count, manual SOS button |
| **History** | Alert log filtered by Manual / Automatic / All, with total alerts & this-week stats |
| **Contacts** | Add, reorder (priority 1–5), and remove (swipe-to-delete with confirmation) emergency contacts |
